You have might confused little bit
Here i am trying to explain at my best

Remember first you have to traverse over to find the target and
remove it so itrate over
how to iterate in a tree

properties
-----------
each Node has one right node and left Node
it is connected each other with parent child relation ship

itretion
---------
1. assign currentNode = root;
2. if targetData < currentNode.data,
then:currentNode =currentNode.left
3. else if targetData > currentNode.data,
then:currentNode = currentNode.right 
4. else: it will be the target value

but there are many cases we have to check

case:1
    10
   / \
  8   11
 / \
4   9

1. Here we have to remove 10 ,currentNode = root;
2. check currentNode has both left and right Node 
   left !=null && currentNode.right !=null
3. replace the 10 by the smallest value in the right side
   to get minimum value we are creating a recursive function
   called getMinValue hase parameter
