properties
binary search tree(BST)
HEAPS-(complete tree, full tree, perfect tree)
Tries

complete = fill the node till last or except last level

BST 
it is a binary tree
it has one root node
and it left node contains the number less than the root
right contains the number greater than the root
it repeats over the entire tree on the basis of parent

complexiety 
insert - 0(logn) - (average case)
worst case = 0(n)
delete - 0(logn)

3 Types of traversing :0(n)
inOrder - (left->root->right)
preOrder - (root->left->right)
PostOrder - (left->right->root)
