*lets come to the problem
Here we have to add or create a Linked List
we know that linkedList consits of node that have data and refrence 

Here we used to add data using a function called addNode(num)
with parameter a number
whenver it calls,an object created and assigned that num to data variable in that specific object
as we already defined in that addNode function
and it checks head is null(we already defined it as empty)
if it is true then add the new object to the head
head = newObj;
tail = newObj
though the head and tail is same for the element if there is oly the 
elment itself also there is no need of next(reference of another element)

if it is false(means there is already an element exists),then
take the tail's next(reference) and then assign the newObj and 
replace tail with newObj
tail.next = newObj;
tail = newObj;

this continous whenever the new num is added
This is how new LinkeList created and new elements are added
note:if new LinkedList created with one element and it has no next(referemce)
if there is another element added to to the existing linked List then
add the ref of the new to the previous and add the new element without refernce

Hello worldies,
As a javascript developer,it was a little hard digestable thing to me
After a While I searched and found some statements
Here is the simple explanation>>>>>
here we have main class called SLinkedList
inside of that a class called Node(it will be considered as base structure of each node in the linked list)
what are the things will be in a node of a linked list?
it has two variables,a data and a reference to another node?exactly.
here we assume data will be integer type. you can take any dataType
here we named our reference is named as next.what actually next contains
reference to the next node,we can take it as node 
so we take the dataType as node.understan? if not or you are javascript 
developer then just think about the let key word what does the let key word
actually doing, we know we dont have to specify the datatype whatever it is
we also have classes and objects inside of the javascipt also 
then what will be the dataType of the object that we make from the specific
class? we cant predict with int string whatever it is, it is the combination
of primary dataTypes right? but we dont bother this when we use it with
javascript. let's come to the point, here Node is class and we can declare
variables with that special kind of datatType called Node
whatever the class we can declare or intialize with that specific dataType
