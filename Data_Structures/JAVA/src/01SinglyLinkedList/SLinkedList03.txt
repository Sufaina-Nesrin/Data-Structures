we ha some nodes
[4|next]....[3|next]....[3|next]....[3|next]....[6|next]

we have to print this by removing duplications.
the answer looks like 
[4|next]....[3|next]....[6|next]

we have one head and a tail
1.Assign the head into temp
2.iterete over it whenever temp gets null
3.Assign temp.next to the next variable
4start another while loop that checks next and current has same value
5.next assign next.next//here we iterate over whenever it reaches different
element to avoid duplications
6.then we get a new element to the next variable when we get out off the loop
7.then we assign the next to the current.next, (current.next = next)
8then assign next to the current(current = next)
9.and also checks next is tail,tail = current
