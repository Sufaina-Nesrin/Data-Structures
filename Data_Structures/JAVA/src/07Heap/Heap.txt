HEAP
min heap,max heap
represents by array

leftChild - 2*i+1
rightChild - 2*i+2

parent - (i-1)/2  (7-1)/2 = 6/2 =3

insertion complexiety O(logn) time
space complexiety O(1)

insert - compare with parent

delete - compare with children(we only delete from the top value)
to delete this assign top by the biggest value
then compare with its children

build a minHeap from an array
[10,5,25,3,22,12]
     10
    /  \
   5    25
 /  \     \

3    22    12
take a last parent means 25
compare its children to find small
then swap with its smallest children
then take the next parent do the same
