Types of sort
----------------
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Quick sort
Heap sort
Merge sort

complexiety of 
Bubble,Insertion , Selection sort is O(n*n)
Quick, Heap, Merge sort is O(nlogn)
complexiety of logn is better than n
so that is nlogn is better here

bubble sort - O(n*n)T,O(1)S
Insertion - 0(n*n)T, O(1)S
